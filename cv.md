### Briefly About Myself: 
My goal is to become independent from circumstances and the material world.  It is important for me to remain a person that people can rely on, the process of self-development and progress is important for me, this is one of the reasons why I decided to become a programmer.  I don't have experience as a junior programmer yet, but I am a very goal-oriented person and I want to achieve good results in the IT.  I am constantly interested in new things and find the necessary information myself.
I tried to learn such languages as:
-***С#*** 
-***Java***
-***Cotlin***
but most of all i liked the language ***JavaScript***!
